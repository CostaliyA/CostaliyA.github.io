## About Me

I am a first-year master student at University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), advised by [Prof. Feng Zhao](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?hl=en&user=r6CvuOUAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). I got a B.E. degree at Communication University of China in 2025. My current research focus is on Vision Language Action models, and I also have a keen interest in [music production](https://space.bilibili.com/28028669/lists/1005054?type=season). I welcome any opportunities for communication!

My core mission is to investigate the simulation of human cognition within AI systems. I focus on building architectures that integrate precision(CV) sensing with deep semantic reasoning(FC&LRM), empowering machines to act(VLA&UMM) decisively in unknown scenarios. Beyond the technical challenges, I am motivated by a profound curiosity about the frontier of AI capabilities and where its ultimate limit resides.
