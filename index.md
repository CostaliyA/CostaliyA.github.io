## About Me

I am a first-year master student at University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), advised by [Prof. Feng Zhao](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?hl=en&user=r6CvuOUAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). I got a B.E. degree at Communication University of China in 2025. My current research focus is on Vision Language Action models, and I also have a keen interest in [music production](https://space.bilibili.com/28028669/lists/1005054?type=season). I welcome any opportunities for communication!

My research focuses on a tri-fold approach to human-like artificial intelligence: **Precision Sensing** (CV), **Deep Reasoning** (FC & LRM), and **Decisive Action** (VLA & UMM). My goal is to synthesize these components into a seamless cognitive loop, exploring the uncharted frontiers of machine intelligence. Beyond the technical challenges, I am profoundly curious about the true potential of this field and remain eager to discover where the ultimate limit of AI truly lies.

## Miscellaneous

Outside of my research, I am a creator at heart. I immerse myself in 📖 reading (with Wang Xiaobo as my favorite author), 🎵 music production (Lo-fi Hip-hop & EDM, [Click to listen to my portfolio](https://space.bilibili.com/28028669/lists/1005054?type=season)🎧), ✍️ creative writing, and  ⚽ table football. I thrive on the sensation of bringing something new into existence. My journey also involves exploring 🎨 visual design, 💫 anime, 📷 photography, and 🎬 movie production. For me, <strong>life is all about  perception and experience<strong>!
